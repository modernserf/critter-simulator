emergence is the creation of complex or chaotic systems from simple and orderly rules.

# structure

- intro
    + lascaux
- conways life
    + definition of emergence
    + life rules
    + show chaos
    + identify order
        * stable / oscillators
        * glider
        * breeders
    + some of these were _created_ but many of them were _discovered_
- flocking
    + cellular automata only have "alive" and "dead" states
        * a glider is not an individual, but a collection of neighboring cells
        * the consitutuents of a glider do not move, they produce the next generation in the next position
        * beautiful in its simplicity, but impractical and alien as a model of life
    + micro vs macro
        * flocking isn't a simulation of life, just a particular behavior
        * boids have more state -- position, bearing, velocity
        * rules designed to create behavior, not other way 'round
    + similarities
        * simple rules for determining next position based on current state and neighbors
        * completely deterministic -- no randomness
        * no memory -- each position can be determined from previous position alone
- critters
    + behaviors
        * not a complete lifecycle, but wanted to capture the essence of guinea pigs
        * exhaustive research
        * eating, cowering, companionship, pooping
        * ran out of time before i could implement squeaking
    + differences vs flocking
        * critters have time-related thresholds for behaviors
        * critters have destinations for some behaviors
        * less elegant rules -> less surprising results
- failures
    + agents/actors/neural networks
        * minsky's Society of Mind
        * trying to capture behavior in an elegant way that resembles how guinea pigs actually think
        * emergence is a property both internal to the critter, as simple instincts form complex behaviors, and in the interactions between critters
        * turns out this takes more than a couple evenings to solve





# lascaux caves

since the dawn of time, humanity has yearned to simulate a guinea pig village in a web browser. The cave paintings at lascaux are some of the earliest documented attempts to capture the essence of a creature in a representational model.

I'm going to fast forward a little bit.

# early AI

In order to simulate a guinea pig in a web browser, let alone a whole village of them, we need to have computers and a paradigm for representing intelligence. Perhaps not surprisingly, the two are strongly related.

- critters run from cursor
- Critters run to food
- Critters prefer to be near each other
- Critters prefer to be in houses
- critters prefer to eat food that other critters are already eating
- Critters make sounds when hungry/angry
- critters poop a lot (use ðŸ’© emoji?)
- critters will investigate new/moved structures
